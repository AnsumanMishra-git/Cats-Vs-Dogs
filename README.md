# Cats-Vs-Dogs
A very famous kaggle problem , solved using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Besides i have deployed the model using Flask. 

I used 8048 images to train my model and 2000 images for testing. 
To improve the accuracy , you can  -
  1) Use more number of training images
  2) Increase the number of epochs.
